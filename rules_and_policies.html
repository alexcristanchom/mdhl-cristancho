                                        adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</li>

                                        minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                                        assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                                        whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                                        from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
                                        field may be required to play all their games away.</li>
